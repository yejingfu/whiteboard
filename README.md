White Board
==========

This is a collaborative tool built by HTML5 technology.

## Overview

This application is aiming to provide a collaborative white board so that the co-workers can communicate in different ways.

All attendees are able to sketch on the main white board simultaneously. Each peer's status can be synchronized by the server. Meanwhile the application provides video and audio communication.

The user interface is looking like below:
